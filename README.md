# Rustin

## What is this?

This is a simple binary loader written in Rust with the help of [goblin](https://docs.rs/goblin/0.2.3/goblin/).

## Why?

1. It is fun
2. Having a binary loader allows me to inspect and manipulate binaries programatically, which can be very useful.
3. Educational
4. A useful way to get familiar with Rust

## What can I do?

Only ELF and MachO binaries are supported at the moment

- `-s` to list section
- `-S` to list symbols
- `-l` to list libraries

## Are you sold on the name?

Nope
